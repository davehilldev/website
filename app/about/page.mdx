# About

For 23 years now, I've poured my heart and soul into web development. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript, I wield these tools like an artist, crafting user-centric interfaces that connect with people on a deeper level. My dedication shows in seamless technology that blends seamlessly into the user experience, feeling more like an extension of themselves than just a website.

Accessibility is important. Everyone deserves an opportunity to sit at the digital table, regardless of their abilities or devices. That's why I champion inclusive design, ensuring my creations are open and welcoming to all.

## Not limiting myself...
So, I'm not just a web developer. I'm an artist, a facilitator, and an advocate for a more inclusive web. Technology should empower, not exclude, and I'm dedicated to making that vision a reality, one pixel at a time.
